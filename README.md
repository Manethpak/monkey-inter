# Monkey Inter

## Introduction

This repo is my implementation of the monkey interpretor based on the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). Taking this journey since I've always been interested in compilers and interpreters, how they work and how to implement them. I've only learn about it from the thoery or some basic implementation on the internet, never had the chance to dive deep into it. Hopefully, by the end of this book I'll be able to satisfied my curiosity.

I'll be documentation the progress of this journey here along the way.

## Progress

- [x] Chapter 1 (06/02/2024 - 07/02/2024)
- [x] Chapter 2 (07/02/2024 - 18/03/2024)
- [] Chapter 3
- [] Chapter 4

### Chapter 1

Chapter 1 was quite short, it was just a simple introduction to the book and a simple implementation of the lexer. Nothing too complicated to understand, finish it quickly.

### Chapter 2

Okay, the parser is quite confusing, took me a whole month to finish (I was kinda busy with work + other project). I have to go back and forth multiple time to understand the concept of the parser. The book is explaining the concept in a very clear way, but I'm just not used to the concept of the parser. I'm not sure if I understand it correctly, but I'll just move on to the next chapter and see if I can understand it better.
