# Monkey Inter

## Introduction

This repo is my implementation of the monkey interpretor based on the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). Taking this journey since I've always been interested in compilers and interpreters, how they work and how to implement them. I've only learn about it from the thoery or some basic implementation on the internet, never had the chance to dive deep into it. Hopefully, by the end of this book I'll be able to satisfied my curiosity.

I'll be documentation the progress of this journey here along the way.
